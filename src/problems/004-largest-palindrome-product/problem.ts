// Problem 4: Largest palindrome product
// A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

// Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two n-digit numbers.

const largestPalindromeProduct = (number: number): number => {
  // TODO
  return 0;
};
